Description:

This program implements a linked list class using pointers and object-oriented
programming. You can enter integers into a linked list and have it be printed in
ascending or descending order. The amount of prime numbers in your list will also
be printed.

Instructions:

1) Compile the program with 
	make

2) Run the program with
	run

3) Here's what the program might look like:

	Please enter a number: 4
	Do you want another num (y or n): y
	Please enter a number: 34
	Do you want another num (y or n): y
	Please enter a number: 2
	Do you want another num (y or n): n
	Sort ascending or descending (a or d)? a
	Your linked list is: 2 4 34 
	Amount of prime numbers: 1
	Do you want to do this again (y or n)? n

EXTRA CREDIT:
	I did the selection sort extra credit. The void swap() function is used in
	conjunction with the selectionSort function and swaps the nodes to sort them.
